                    <b>ADTRAN, Inc. - Software Design Engineer - May 2014 to present</b><br />
                    Here I work as part of an AGILE team that is responsible for group of features that our products offer that fall under the umbrella of packet voice technologies (such as SIP, MGCP).
                      Our responsibilities include: managing the portion of our C++ code base that directly relates to these technologies, supporting any issues or bugs found by customers or other engineers
                      when using our products, and adding new features as necessary.
                      <br /><br />
                      As part of this team, I participated equally in all of our responsibilities, as well as performed as the team's scrum master for almost the entire duration of my employment.

                    <b>ADTRAN Inc. - Student Worker - Summer 2011, Summer 2012, Fall 2012, Summer 2013</b> <br />
                    Completed 4 terms as part of the Cooperative Education program. <br />
                    <br />
                    First term was spent in product qualification, which is the last stage of testing before shipping software to our customers.
                      As part of this department, I maintained my own test bed in which I ran tests, both automatic and manual.
                    <br /> <br />
                    Second term I worked on a proof of concept that building our software in a Linux environment would reduce the build times that we normally saw when building in Windows.
                      For this project, I did the necessary leg work for 3 different products so I could present a before and after demonstration to stakeholders.
                    <br /><br />
                    My third and forth terms were spent in a program management team that focused on AGILE as well as the interaction between our AGILE teams and customers.  For these terms,
                     I worked on several different projects depending on the needs of different teams at the time.  The first project was a web crawler in C# that was later used for testing
                     the web component of our products.  Secondly, I made a front-end application for Clarity (a PPM tool that we used) using Excel.  This allowed users to be able to mass edit
                     and add information to Clarity in the familiar environment of Excel.  Lastly, I worked on integration code for keeping two of our PPM tools in sync.
